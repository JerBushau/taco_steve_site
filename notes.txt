TODO:
-----
- Learn more about Sass and how to structure the related directories and how to better logically break things up. (look further into OOCSS concepts and ideas)
- Pitch the site to Steve!

Goals:
------
- Serve as a single page 'homebase' for his web presence.
- Simple UI that is easy and a fun to use.
- Display the menu and contact/location info along with links to Steve's very positive reviews on social media.
- Primarily targeting mobile users.
- Use a mobile first strategy and keep cross browser compatibility in mind throughout.
- Site should load fast and not hinder users on a slow connection to the web.

Several tools were used to create this site and achieve the aforementioned goals, such as:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Sass - a CSS pre-processor
- Auto-prefixer - a tool for adding vendor prefixes to CSS
- Babel - a JS compiler that allows the use of modern JS syntax/features

To automate the use of these tools I used NPM scripts and Nodemon to watch and update files during development.

Things I learned from developing the Taco Steve website:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Cross browser compatibility is something that can require a lot of thought and effort, however it is very satisfying to accomplish.
- The importance of a mobile first design philosophy.
- CSS animations/transitions are fun/look great and there are a number of properties that they play particularly well with e.g. transform: translate() scale() rotate() and opacity. While others don't play so well, e.g. margin. Learning this was critical to improving the performance of the site, especially on mobile devices.
- The Google maps API has awesome and extensive documentation and the maps themselves are easy to style (although I ended up leaving this one default).
